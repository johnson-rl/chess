# Chess - [View Online](https://masterchess.herokuapp.com/)

This chess game visualizer was built using [jchess built by bmarini](https://github.com/bmarini/jchess).  I have made modifications so that one can load both a FEN starting position and PGN so that you can make moves from the given starting position.

## Instructions

1) Input the game's FEN in the first input box
2) If the game is starting from the beginning, you can leave the FEN box blank
3) Input the game's PGN into the second input box
4) Press the 'Load Game' button
